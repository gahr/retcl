= retcl: Tcl client library for Redis
endif::generate_manpage[]

The retcl module is an event-driven, object-oriented, https://redis.io[Redis]
client library for the https://www.tcl-lang.org/[Tcl] programming language. The
library exposes a single `retcl` class, conveniently packaged as a sourceable
https://www.tcl-lang.org/man/tcl8.6/TclCmd/tm.htm#M9[Tcl module].  Instances of
this class represent connections to a https://redis.io[Redis] server and are
used to send requests in the form of native https://redis.io[Redis] commands
and retrieve responses.

Other than a few book-keeping methods, `retcl` instances transparently
handle https://redis.io[Redis] commands as first-class methods.
As an example, `r SET K Hello` can be used to set the value of the key _K_
to the string _Hello_. This is achieved by proxying all unknown methods to the
https://redis.io[Redis] server by concatenating all arguments, effectively
making `retcl` instances completely decoupled from any version of Redis.  This
has several advantages:

* A `retcl` instance does not need to know about the semantics of a
  particular https://redis.io[Redis] command. This includes syntax checks,
  context verification and arguments validation, which are offloaded to the
  https://redis.io[Redis] server. As a consequence, the code base remains clean
  and small.

* New commands introduced by a server upgrade are immediately available to
  a live application.

== Methods
endif::generate_manpage[]

=== Construction

[source,tcl]
----
set r [retcl new ?-noconnect? ?host? ?port?]
retcl create r ?-noconnect? ?host? ?port?
----

Create an instance *r* of `retcl`. By default, the client automatically
connects to localhost on port 6379. If `-noconnect` is specified, the client is
created in disconnected mode.

=== Connection / disconnection

[source,tcl]
----
$r connect ?host? ?port?
$r disconnect
$r connected
----

The `connect` method can be used to connect to a different host and port. It is
an error to call this method on an already connected client. The `disconnect`
method can be called no matter the connection status; it disconnects the client
from the current host, if any. The `connected` method can be used to query the
current connection status. It returns a true result if the client is connected
and a false result otherwise.

=== Interaction with Redis

[source,tcl]
----
set rid1 [$r SET key val] ;# rid stands for result id
$r result $rid1 ;# OK

set rid2 [$r GET key]
$r result $rid2] ;# val

$r resultType $rid1 ;# SimpleString
$r resultType $rid2 ;# BulkString

$r -sync GET key ;# val

proc mycb {id type body} {
    puts "  id: $id"
    puts "type: $type"
    puts "body: $body"
}

$r -cb mycb GET key ;# returns immediately and arrange for mycb to be invoked
                    ;# with {rds:1 BulkString val} when the result arrives
----

As shown in the examples above, the interaction with https://redis.io[Redis] is
very straightforwards. Any methods not directly understood by the `retcl` class
are forwarded to the https://redis.io[Redis] server, along with any additional
arguments provided. The result is a small string representing a result id. Each
call to https://redis.io[Redis] produces a new result id, which can then
be queried to inspect its status, type, and value.

By using the `-sync` switch, it is possible to have https://redis.io[Redis]
commands block and only return as soon as the result is available. In this
case, the return value is the value returned by https://redis.io[Redis].

By using the `-cb` switch, it is possible to arrange for a callback procedure
to be called whenever the result is ready. In this case, the command returns
immediately.

=== Configuration

By default, `retcl` objects operate in asynchronous mode: they return
immediately and produce a result id (rid) that can be inspected later on. The
methods `-async`, `+async` and `?async` can be used to disable, enbale, and
query this setting. The asynchronous behaviour is off, methods wait and
return the values returned by https://redis.io[Redis] instead of a result id.

A cache of all results is kept by default. This allows to query previously
returned results. The `-keepcache`, `+keepcache`, and `?keepcache` methods can
be used to disable, enable, and query this setting. When the results cache is
disabled, results are removed from the cache as soon as they are retrieved by
the client.

=== Error handling

A custom error handler can be setup with the `errorHandler` method. The
argument is a command prefix that gets expanded and additioned with an error
message string. Passing an empty command prefix resets the error handler to the
default `error` proc.

=== Pipelining

A pipeline can be built with the `pipeline` method. The argument is a script
which gets evaluated in the context of the caller. Commands to the
https://redis.io[Redis] server are held for the duration of the script and
released as a bulk when the script ends.

=== Publish / subscribe

Publish / subscribe callbacks for specific items can be specified with the
`callback` method. The `item` argument is a pattern or channel as in PSUBSCRIBE
and SUBSCRIBE. The `callback` argument is a command prefix. Whenever a message
arrives on the specific channel, the command prefix is called by appending the
type of the message, the pattern that was subscribed to, the actual channel,
and the payload.
